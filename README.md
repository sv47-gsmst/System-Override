System Override

System Override is a chaotic maze survival game where you navigate procedurally generated levels, avoid enemies, and interact with switches while managing your health. This project evolved from a simple maze prototype into a full-featured, playable game with dynamic challenges.

Features

Procedurally generated maze levels with infinite random generation after level 15

Enemies that chase the player and shoot bullets

Functional exit and decoy switches, including decoys that spawn damaging particles

Player heals 25% each level

Health and time UI displays

Intro screen with developer credits and game-over transition

Post-level-15 prompt to continue or exit

Polished gameplay and interactive mechanics

Controls

Move: Arrow keys or WASD

Activate Switch: E, Space, C, or Mouse Click

How to Play

Run main.py with Python 3 and Pygame installed.

Navigate the maze, avoid enemies, and activate the exit switch to progress.

Watch out for decoy switches — they spawn damaging particles!

After every 15 levels, decide whether to continue random levels or exit the game.
